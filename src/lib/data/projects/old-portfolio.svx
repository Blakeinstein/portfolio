## Design Ideas
The design of the website was inspired by the album art for the track "[Light Mind](https://www.last.fm/music/Krosia/_/Light+Mind)" 
by [Krosia](https://www.last.fm/music/Krosia). I deeply adore the vastness of outer space, and spacewave has been my 
goto genre to achieve that state of mind. I found Krosia from his song [Sunlight](https://www.last.fm/music/Krosia/Sunlight), 
but the album art for Light Mind was what lived in my head rent free.

## Implementation
I originally built the website with just Typescript, ThreeJS and html, with [Navigo](https://github.com/krasimir/navigo) used for routing and lit element for constructing page contents.
I later migrated to [Astro](https://astro.build/) for the sake of SEO and performance. I additionally used [SwupJS](https://swup.js.org/) to implement seamless page transitions due to the fact that I had
a 3d scene used for the background. I am extremely proud of the micro-interactions I implemented, like the [gooey effect on the social links](https://old.blaine.vip/socials/), and the 
contact form error messages. I also used blobity to implement the blob like cursor on desktop views. The website is hosted on Github Pages,
and the source code is available on Github.

## Fun Facts
- It took me ages to settle on a design for the website. But once I found the album art for Light Mind, I knew I had to use it.
- The overall website was built in a single day.
- I never bothered to update the content of the website, the info was outdated the day I made it publically available.
- I was able to obtain a free [`is-a.dev`](https://www.is-a.dev/) domain under my name, which I used for the website.
