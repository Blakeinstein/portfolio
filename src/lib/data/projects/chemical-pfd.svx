## Background and Reasoning
Chemical PFD was the project I pursued during my fellowship at IIT Bombay, under their FOSSEE initiative.
The project was to build a simple chemical process flow diagram tool to enable Chemical Engineering labs primarly at IIT
Bombay to construct PFDs for their experiments. The future scope of the tool included the ability to simulate the PFDs 
and determine various chemical process metrics.

## Implementation
The project initially started with a pre-lim requirement to build a [simple tool to draw a network of circles](https://github.com/Blakeinstein/Circle-Network)
to demonstrate proficiency in PyQT.
Like the pre-lim project, Chemical PFD was built using PyQt5 and Python. It also uses [FMan's Build System (FBS)](https://build-system.fman.io/) to enable
faster iterations with a more robust build process. I worked in a team of 2 in a Pair Programming process, with me focusing on the GUI elements and my teammate
focusing on the diagram engine. The project was built in a span of 2 months.

## Fun Facts
- Was coined the best software on the FOSSEE 2020 presentation panel.
- The questions I wrote on StackOverflow while learning PyQt5 and FBS are my biggest contributors to my StackOverflow score.
- This was my first professional experience, and it was paid ðŸŽ‰.
